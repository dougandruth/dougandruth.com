A good night by anyone&#8217;s standard. And technologically, it was a thing of beauty.<\/p>\n<p>I have to say that the start of the evening was looking grim. The wind had picked up. The whole rig was in danger of becoming a sail. My neighbor was still mocking me about the fantastic set of hooters I had constructed above the doorway. Then the sun went over the horizon and all was good.<\/p>\n<p>The video screens lit up and the sound was turned on. It all just&#8230; worked. As if I had just gone out and bought the system at some yuppie Halloween superstore (something I was accused of several times).<\/p>\n<p>The key thing here is, in fact, the sound. Yes the eyeballs have sound. No it doesn&#8217;t make any sense, but it&#8217;s just one of those things I&#8217;ve learned that everything must have a sound to have an identity. So I gave it a voice and you can hear it in the video below. The other thing I have learned is that there is no substitute for proper amplification. This year I employed the Roland <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rolandus.com\/products\/productdetails.php?ProductId=583&amp;ParentId=33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KC-350<\/a> combo amp which made the house shake. It could be heard a block away. It made dogs howl.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, kids were truly mesmerized. I&#8217;m used to the parents wanting to take a second look, but children actually delayed their pursuit of sugar to stand and stare. There is no higher complement.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to all who dropped by. For those who couldn&#8217;t, this please enjoy the video. And don&#8217;t forget to turn the sound up.<\/p>\n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/eyeproject10.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/eyeproject10.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_eyeproject10.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"545\"\n             data-title=\"Front of house\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"7cf870984433aa26c9225964cfa15c3a\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/cache\/eyeproject10.jpg-nggid03545-ngg0dyn-600x400x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Front of house\"\n             title=\"Front of house\"\n              width=\"600\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/eyeproject9.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/eyeproject9.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_eyeproject9.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"550\"\n             data-title=\"Closeup\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"1ae03e3b3b5dc0e46ed34f78ba71592d\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2009\/cache\/eyeproject9.jpg-nggid03550-ngg0dyn-600x400x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Closeup\"\n             title=\"Closeup\"\n              width=\"600\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Halloween 2009: Gigantic Floating Eyeballs\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fFzAYIpZSww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We gave out candy to 196 kids plus one father in a Rush concert shirt.

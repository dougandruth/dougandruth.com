I planned on writing another so that the birds would have two alternating speils. With one week left, this isn&#8217;t going to happen. I need one good short speil.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last several weeks I have been learing to use some new software. There is this lighting queue program called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freestylerdmx.be\/\" target=\"_blank\">FreeStyler<\/a>. It&#8217;s free and seems to do most things I need it to do. And it&#8217;s free!<\/p>\n<p>The most important feature of FreeStyler is its ability to run sequences in parallel. This makes life easy because the bird&#8217;s sequence can be started independantly from the other lighting sequences.<\/p>\n<p>Each FreeStyler sequence can be MIDI controlled, so I can plop the audio into <a href=\"http:\/\/cakewalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cakewalk<\/a> along with MIDI events that trigger the lighting queues. This should be easy&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here are the ravens mounted up for programming: Now, all I have to do is: Write a script Record the voices Create about a thousand stop-motion animation frames Integrate the animation in with the lighting queues Make a gravestone for the ravens to sit on I am totaly screwed.

This we projected on the house so that we didn&#8217;t need to build the whole room. Falling rocks were animated over the image to simulate the destruction of the temple, triggered on a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.frightprops.com\/video-visual-effects\/digital-video-players\/sprite-seamless-looping-hd-triggerable-video-player.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sprite <\/a>video player.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http:\/\/dougandruth.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/back-wall-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Still frame from Raiders of the Lost Ark\" class=\"wp-image-2283\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/back-wall-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/back-wall-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/back-wall-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/back-wall-620x349.jpg 620w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/back-wall.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedestal was fabricated out of wood and carved foam with foam hardener. In the center was a pneumatic-driven lift mechanism with a Chachapoyan Fertility Idol that we bought on Etsy. Turns out you can buy anything on Etsy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/dougandruth.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/20211030_131248_HDR-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2288\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/20211030_131248_HDR-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/20211030_131248_HDR-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/20211030_131248_HDR-1-1151x1536.jpg 1151w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/20211030_131248_HDR-1-1535x2048.jpg 1535w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/20211030_131248_HDR-1-620x827.jpg 620w, http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/20211030_131248_HDR-1-scaled.jpg 1919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As an almost last minute addition, we introduced an ankle blaster on the stairs to simulate the blow dart scene. The compressed air blast worked really good as a scare because it was combined with a stereo blowgun sound effect that panned across the stairs. As in past years, the whole show was run on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.venuemagic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">VenueMagic <\/a>software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all, we had just over 200 kids. We&#8217;ll call it a &#8220;rebuilding&#8221; year. It was definitely the best prepared we have ever been with the setup mostly done at 3pm. Having friends Suchi and Sarath over to hand out candy also made the evening the easiest and most enjoyable we have ever had.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The opening to Raiders of the Lost Ark has to be one of the best sequences in the history of cinema.

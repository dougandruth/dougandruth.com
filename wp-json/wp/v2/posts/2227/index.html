We purchased a couple more skeletons (you can never have enough skeletons) and built a couple new props including a treasure chest. The Jolly Roger and Pirates of the Caribbean samples we had from <a href=\"http:\/\/dougandruth.com\/blog\/halloween-2006\/\">the last time we did pirates<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to beat a pirate theme. The story elements are universal. If we had put more effort in it we would not have gotten a better response. The goal is to set the mood with props and then hit all the emotional buttons with lighting and music. There&#8217;s no big scare which is good and bad. It&#8217;s good that people get the theme. It&#8217;s bad that there&#8217;s no gag to scare them. The gag is a challenge to achieve and not really something we have ever gotten right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talking skeleton was run as a stand-alone prop with its own audio and control system based on an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/2342\">Adafruit Audio FX Mini<\/a> sound board triggered by a retro-reflective light sensor. The rest of the system ran on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.venuemagic.com\/\">VenueMagic <\/a>show controller triggered by a light beam sensor. As usual, the audio system was pushing enough power to make you think there were real canons being fired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pirate Halloween 2017\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qc6YSHmq94M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/dougandruth.com\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2017\/IMG_8785.JPG\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/dougandruth.com\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2017\/IMG_8798.JPG\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Halloween was almost in danger of just being yet another talking skeleton.

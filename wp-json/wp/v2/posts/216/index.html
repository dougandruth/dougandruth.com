Sure, we&#8217;d wear our costumes to school for show and tell or some more pointed Halloween activity. But costumes during the day? That was kids stuff. Literally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The real fun started when it got dark. Usually about 6:00 it would be time to break out the flashlights and glow sticks. Remember when glow sticks first came out? I do. That was awesome.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">My memory of childhood is flawed at best. I am sure that Halloween wasn&#8217;t quite as wonderful as I like to remember it. Still, I know two things: My Mother served dinner at 5:00 every one of my days growing up. And I would not have gone out without having eaten first.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Why then does trick-or-treating start so early? I need it to be dark.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yes, there are visual effects I use that don&#8217;t work in daylight. I don&#8217;t want the &#8220;quality&#8221; of the display to be diminished for early arrivals, but really It&#8217;s about me. I don&#8217;t want people to see me. At 5:00, I&#8217;m still sweating my ass off trying to screw in that last light bulb. It&#8217;s not pretty.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Actually it was 7:00 when Ruth called to me on the roof. There was one last thing I needed to get working, but it was too late. Halloween was over.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The good news is that the talking ravens worked.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Did they provoke the reaction &#8211; the raw emotion that I expected? No. No they did not, but the technology held up. Here is proof:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">[tube]http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f1A9mhd0Uw0[\/tube]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To my surprise, I had forgotten to video record the birds on Halloween. I made this video after pulling them from the lawn. I didn&#8217;t have it in me to run the cables back outside again. Still pictures will be in another post.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Next year I&#8217;ll make them say something different. I&#8217;m thinking of building a much more frightening centerpiece. I&#8217;ll probably have the birds react to whatever that is.

But that&#8217;s not why we went there.<\/p>\n<p>Eating at Araxi (and writing about it) requires some explanation because it is not one of the best restaurants in the world and, quite honestly, our time is valuable. We were going to be in Whistler for the Winter Olympics, but our knowledge of Araxi ties back to having watched the TV show <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fox.com\/hellskitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hell&#8217;s Kitchen<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not proud to say we watched <em>Hell&#8217;s Kitchen<\/em>. It&#8217;s a reality TV show that features Chef Gordon Ramsey berating aspiring chefs until they break. Unfortunately, the previous season featured Andy Husbands, chef\/owner of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tremont647.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tremont 647<\/a>, a restaurant we have eaten in and enjoyed several times. We would have otherwise stopped watching. Probably.<\/p>\n<p>Why Andy entered into a competition that is clearly more interested in humiliating people than showing their skill is not known. Long story short, we bumped into Dave Levey, winner of <em>Hell&#8217;s Kitchen<\/em>, at Tremont 647 and felt compelled to check out his &#8220;prize&#8221; of getting to work at Araxi.<\/p>\n<p>The connection between Gordon Ramsey and Araxi is thin. Apparently he is just a shill for the restaurant. While Ramsey is known for Michelin starred restaurants, Araxi is not in the same league. Not to suggest that it was bad in any way, but it was way over hyped on <em>Hell&#8217;s Kitchen<\/em> as some kind of mountain-top paradise.<\/p>\n<p>What Araxi is might best be described as a slightly over styled restaurant with fresh, well prepared seafood and efficient service.<\/p>\n<p>During the Olympics, Araxi was a busy place. We were told that they had double the amount of kitchen staff on that they normally would. The front entrance was jammed, but after cutting through the crowd we were seated immediately.<\/p>\n<p>After drinks were served we received an amuse bouche of mushrooms in a cauliflower puree. This was a bit disappointing. Aside from it not tasting like much (our palette was not amused?), it was in an odd serving dish &#8211; kind of like a big spoon. Bigger than you wanted to put in your mouth, but difficult to use a utensil in. Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/araxi-2010\/img_0302.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"cauliflower puree with mushrooms\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/araxi-2010\/img_0302.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/araxi-2010\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0302.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"796\"\n             data-title=\"Amuse Bouche\"\n             data-description=\"cauliflower puree with mushrooms\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"125620153282ce2b8ca3edfcb97e616c\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/araxi-2010\/cache\/img_0302.jpg-nggid03796-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Amuse Bouche\"\n             title=\"Amuse Bouche\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n<p>Ruth&#8217;s seared foie gras with apple, pear, and cherry chutney and toasted brioche was excellent.

While the the ball-and-socket allows for the rod to swivel 360\u00b0 around the pivot point, it allows only a couple of degrees of movement up and down. That is if you screw it down on a flat surface.<\/p>\n<p>I figured out that by cannibalizing a rod end, I could screw the ball down atop another ball. This gives a lot greater freedom of movement. By doing this I&#8217;m able to place the rod at a steeper angle; thus, the servo can be placed closer.

The best restaurants have the best training and the best staff overall. To a point, it&#8217;s almost expected that if a chef is busy being featured on TV, they won&#8217;t have time to be in the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>We were thrilled just to see Chef Dufresne on the Saturday night we dined at <a href=\"http:\/\/wd-50.com\" target=\"_blank\">WD-50<\/a>. It wasn&#8217;t so much that <em>he<\/em> was there, but what his presence represented. WD-50 is still small. It&#8217;s the chef&#8217;s only restaurant. Tucked away on a quiet street in SoHo, WD-50 still has the feel of a neighborhood eatery. Maybe it will stay that way, or more to the point, will remain the only one. It&#8217;s nice to have eaten there before it gets franchised.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 180px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/img_0095.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/img_0095.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0095.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"468\"\n             data-title=\"img_0095\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"e0637456cddeb99e4c2d0403ee0ea655\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/cache\/img_0095.jpg-nggid03468-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"img_0095\"\n             title=\"img_0095\"\n              width=\"180\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        View from the bar.<\/h3>\n<p>Wylie, as it turns out, is a really nice guy. Or at least he knows how to make his customers happy. After consuming the tasting menu with wine pairing (meaning, after drinking a lot of wine), we worked up the courage to ask for a picture. Really, we wanted only to take his picture. It seemed fitting since we had just photographed our whole meal.<\/p>\n<p>While trying to sound respectful and not too touristy, as if there was any hope of that, we asked a waiter if pictures we allowed. We were immediately ushered into the kitchen. After a short time, Wylie looked up from his work, shook our hands and posed with us. It was obvious that he had done this a million times before.<\/p>\n<p>So it was a nice end to the evening, but how was the food? For the most part, excellent. But we have pretty high standards.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Octopus, lily bulb, pickled mulberry, and tahini with Hubert Clavelin Cremant du Jura &#8216;Brut-Comte&#8217; NV (Jura, France)<\/h3>\n<p>There should have been a picture here, but we ate it before attempting to use Ruth&#8217;s iPhone to take pictures.<\/p>\n<p>The octopus was very good. A nice combination of unusual flavors and a not-too-chewy texture. The sparkling wine selection complemented the starter well.<\/p>\n<p>Incidentally, we did not take pictures when we ate at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frenchlaundry.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">French Laundry<\/a>. We went in thinking that photography would be an unwanted distraction from our meal. It was the right decision.<\/p>\n<p>WD-50, however,\u00a0 is not the French Laundry. WD-50 is notably short on space. While the service was attentive and exacting, the tables are right on top of one another. The waitstaff at times has to climb over you to clear each course. After eleven courses, we became very <em>aware<\/em> of the servers. If a comparison must be made, we will say that the staff at the French Laundry was so smooth there were times we failed to notice that the silverware had been changed.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/img_0055.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/img_0055.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0055.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"454\"\n             data-title=\"img_0055\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"7e4f6a1dabbb6087815a2b1f058b2fef\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/wd-50-2009\/cache\/img_0055.jpg-nggid03454-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"img_0055\"\n             title=\"img_0055\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        Everything bagel, smoked salmon threads, and crispy cream cheese with Hubert Clavelin Cremant du Jura &#8216;Brut-Comte&#8217; NV (Jura, France)<\/h3>\n<p>This course was cool &#8211; literally.

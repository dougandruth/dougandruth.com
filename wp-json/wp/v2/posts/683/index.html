Unfortunately there two drawbacks with that: First, no one is impressed by paper mache. It lacks any kind of kinetic quality that people expect and want. (It&#8217;s hard to beat a strobe light in a window.) Second, we had a goal of making things more <em>interactive<\/em> this year.<\/p>\n<p>Enter the pi\u00f1ata. What&#8217;s more fun than a pi\u00f1ata? Nothing is more fun than a pi\u00f1ata! Once.<\/p>\n<p>So the question becomes how to resurrect a pi\u00f1ata after it&#8217;s been beaten? Our solution is to allow the pi\u00f1ata to break itself in a controlled manner and put itself back together. Cake.<\/p>\n<p>Or maybe the <em>real<\/em> question is what comes <em>out<\/em> of the pi\u00f1ata? Maybe the payoff is more important than the pi\u00f1ata itself? Philosophical questions aside, there is one thing we do know: It must be a donkey.<\/p>\n<p>Any Internet search for a traditional \ufeffMexican pi\u00f1ata reveals either a donkey-shaped pi\u00f1ata or a star-shaped thing that would be hard to work with. The donkey is basically a box with legs and a head. Remember kids: When automating anything, your ideal model is a box with legs and a head.<\/p>\n<p>The game plan is to cut the pi\u00f1ata in half, hinge it at the top, and make the thing open and close whenever someone hits it. We&#8217;ll use a security vibration detector to determine when the donkey has been slapped.<\/p>\n<p>Since the pi\u00f1ata is made to be destroyed, the first step is to make an inner structure out of plywood. Note the use of duct-tape: Crucial in any design where resiliency is a must.<\/p>\n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2011\/boxes.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"The box is pulled apart by the thin black wires.\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2011\/boxes.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2011\/thumbs\/thumbs_boxes.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"1209\"\n             data-title=\"Basic box mechanism\"\n             data-description=\"The box is pulled apart by the thin black wires.\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"7f1d3f07a035506bd536c2ccfad0b6be\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/halloween-2011\/cache\/boxes.jpg-nggid041209-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Basic box mechanism\"\n             title=\"Basic box mechanism\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n<p>The hinge is constructed from two aluminum bars.

The reality is that I started by attaching one piece of aluminum and it wobbled. So I attached another piece and it got stiffer. A dozen pieces later we have a nice rigid frame that can be attached to the end of a pole.<\/p>\n<p>So, we&#8217;re done, right? No.<\/p>\n<p>Remember the <a href=\"http:\/\/dougandruth.com\/blog\/?p=338\" target=\"_self\">aforementioned<\/a> mirror at the other end of the pole? The mirror assembly weighs about 15 lbs. The screens also weigh about 15 lbs. When you put one of each at the end of a 6 foot pole&#8230;?<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right. The pole twists. Especially if the pole is made out of aluminum. When the mirror moves the screen does not move with it. I&#8217;m screwed.<\/p>\n<p>There are many solutions to this problem, most of which I have not the time or money to implement. What I do have is aircraft cable. The structure will either submit or destroy itself. Start the betting now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My first mechanical Halloween project was made out of PVC pipe.

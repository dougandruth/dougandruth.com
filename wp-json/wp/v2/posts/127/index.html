I learned several years ago that manufacturing things is hard. In fact, the smaller the parts the harder it is.<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, the parts of the bird go together like Lincoln Logs. Objectively, it&#8217;s really hard to make anything out of Lincoln Logs that you can fit up the butt of a hand puppet.<\/p>\n<p>It would be great if only my local hardware store would stock a myriad of little brackets in varying sizes; tiny little metal shapes that would have no use in home construction. But they don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>I know. Some hobby stores carry some Erector Set like things for mounting servos or other small items, but they often get $4 for a \u00bc&#8221; L-bracket and that just doesn&#8217;t seem reasonable. Even at 50\u00a2, you have to ask the question &#8220;How long will it take me to make these with a hack saw and a length of L-bar or U-channel?&#8221; If you cut the parts yourself, you can have any size you want for very little money.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example:<\/p>\n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/talking-ravens\/img_2673.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/talking-ravens\/img_2673.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/talking-ravens\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_2673.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"414\"\n             data-title=\"Neck joint\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"c650c616a056eb0f5d51a8dcaa473a5e\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/talking-ravens\/cache\/img_2673.jpg-nggid03414-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Neck joint\"\n             title=\"Neck joint\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n<p>How to create a neck joint at the top of the backbone? It needs to be at a certain angle and have a certain range of movement. I&#8217;m not sure how it should be done either.

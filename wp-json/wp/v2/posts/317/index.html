The original. The restaurant showcase for Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto is a sleek outpost in the city of cheese steak. Not that Philly doesn&#8217;t have good food, but from the moment you walk up to Morimoto&#8217;s curved white facade you know you&#8217;ve into something different.<\/p>\n<p>Philadelphia itself is a bit different from most large cities. It has a distinct feel of community. The number of local small businesses is noticeable. The central market area is an actual market with butchers and fish mongers with small restaurants rather than being exclusive to fast food eateries like in Boston. It started to make sense why Morimoto opened here rather than two hours north in New York City.\u00a0 And the rent is probably cheaper, too.<\/p>\n<p>            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0127.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0127.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0127.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"470\"\n             data-title=\"Lounge View of the Bar\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"162a0cb5d11885a76769330c6db5f8e3\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/cache\/img_0127.jpg-nggid03470-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Lounge View of the Bar\"\n             title=\"Lounge View of the Bar\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n                     \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0130.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0130.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0130.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"471\"\n             data-title=\"Lounge View of the Window\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"0276b72e9a350716f21879573f853b23\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/cache\/img_0130.jpg-nggid03471-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Lounge View of the Window\"\n             title=\"Lounge View of the Window\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        <\/p>\n<p>We were first seated in the lounge, a small darkened room on the second floor.

Maybe too hip as Doug&#8217;s stool slowly lowered to the floor under his less then trendy weight.

More than just ground tuna, it was a scrumptious mixture of flavors with something slightly crunchy mixed in. With caviar on top and a lychee berry served on the side, this was one of our favorites. It had a good amount of fat in the dish, making it rich and flavorful. This is a characteristic shown in many of Morimoto&#8217;s recipes and shows why the man is a genius: take healthy Japanese food and add fat. It just doesn&#8217;t get any better.<\/p>\n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0154.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0154.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0154.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"475\"\n             data-title=\"Kumamoto Oysters\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"ae63e440bbfbadf2f67101dee95e9fa2\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/cache\/img_0154.jpg-nggid03475-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Kumamoto Oysters\"\n             title=\"Kumamoto Oysters\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n<p>The second course was our least favorite. Forgetting the magic equation of grind fish add fat, we got three perfect raw oysters each topped with something to flavor them. The one with ginger was okay, but the spicy one and bitter one were way too strong. If this were Iron Chef battle oyster, the only comment would have been, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t taste the oyster.&#8221; On a positive note, the flavors were good and different from anything we&#8217;d tasted on an oyster before.<\/p>\n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0157.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0157.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0157.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"476\"\n             data-title=\"Whitefish Carpaccio\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"51b88b87ab96bc6aed19222f254c7983\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/cache\/img_0157.jpg-nggid03476-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Whitefish Carpaccio\"\n             title=\"Whitefish Carpaccio\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n<p>The third course was Whitefish Carpaccio.

Thank you Philadelphia, here&#8217;s your sushi!<\/p>\n<p>All joking aside, the piece of tuna on the plate was otoro. Not just fatty tuna, this is the stuff that makes depleting the seas of tuna in spite of the ecological impact on future generations all worthwhile.<\/p>\n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0177.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0177.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0177.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"482\"\n             data-title=\"Green Tea with Popcorn\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"5c0d5142194639a93359f86229d7bfe2\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/cache\/img_0177.jpg-nggid03482-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Green Tea with Popcorn\"\n             title=\"Green Tea with Popcorn\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n            \n\t\t<div class=\"ngg-gallery-singlepic-image ngg-center\" style=\"max-width: 320px\">\n\t\t\t    \t<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0181.jpg\"\n\t\t     title=\"\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/img_0181.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/thumbs\/thumbs_img_0181.jpg\"\n             data-image-id=\"483\"\n             data-title=\"Chocolate Cake\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n             target='_self'\n             class=\"ngg-fancybox\" rel=\"39a9a9722608230602161b9ede30fb7b\">\n            <img class=\"ngg-singlepic\"\n             src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blog\/wp-content\/gallery\/morimoto-2009\/cache\/img_0181.jpg-nggid03483-ngg0dyn-320x240x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg\"\n             alt=\"Chocolate Cake\"\n             title=\"Chocolate Cake\"\n              width=\"320\"               \/>\n    \t<\/a>\n\t\t      <\/div>\n        \n<p>We were offered tea, one option being the intriguing green tea with popcorn.

Worth it?<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely. Morimoto served up some of the best food human beings get to eat. Compared to other tasting menus they are a bargain. While the service is very good, they are a bit of a volume business. They were able to do eight courses in two hours. We certainly were not rushed, but the place is busy.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that this was one of the few dinners we had without wine. They offered a drink pairing, but we declined in part in because of a bias about the cuisine (the Japanese are not big on wine), but mostly because we had more than our share the night before. Everything in moderation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Morimoto in Philadelphia. The original.

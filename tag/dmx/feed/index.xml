										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year we returned to old school lights and sound. Since we are always asked, the theme was &#8220;spiders and ghosts.&#8221; There were, in fact, spiders and ghosts in addition to rats and gravestones.</p>
<p>Total setup for this year was cut to two days. The technological advance of the year was to place three Altman 6&#215;16 ellipsoidals across the street in the neighbor&#8217;s yard and signaled them with a wireless DMX system. This allowed us to project rather bright 15-foot images on the house. The rest of the images and breakups were projected with 6 Altman MR-16 ellipsoidals hung on the house.</p>
<p>In addition, Ruth got to make use of the spider web gun making highly realistic webs on the porch which even held up in the rain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Team Tyrannicide completed the Beringer Bowl overnight ocean race from Marblehead to Provincetown in just over 14 hours last Friday. Not a fast race  by any stretch of the imagination, but we completed the race unlike 7 other boats.</p>

Even after reinforcements were made with duct tape, the Jolly Roger continued to loom large, casting a sense of foreboding. The new jib was set after pulling the numbers off minutes before the start.</p>

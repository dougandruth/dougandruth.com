<p>This Halloween was almost in danger of just being <a href="http://dougandruth.com/blog/halloween-2015-yet-another-talking-skeleton/">yet another talking skeleton.</a> We were short on time, so building-out a new theme didn&#8217;t seem achievable. We purchased a couple more skeletons (you can never have enough skeletons) and built a couple new props including a treasure chest. The Jolly Roger and Pirates of the Caribbean samples we had from <a href="http://dougandruth.com/blog/halloween-2006/">the last time we did pirates</a>. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s difficult to beat a pirate theme. The story elements are universal. If we had put more effort in it we would not have gotten a better response. The goal is to set the mood with props and then hit all the emotional buttons with lighting and music. There&#8217;s no big scare which is good and bad. It&#8217;s good that people get the theme. It&#8217;s bad that there&#8217;s no gag to scare them. The gag is a challenge to achieve and not really something we have ever gotten right.</p>



<p>The talking skeleton was run as a stand-alone prop with its own audio and control system based on an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2342">Adafruit Audio FX Mini</a> sound board triggered by a retro-reflective light sensor. The rest of the system ran on the <a href="https://www.venuemagic.com/">VenueMagic </a>show controller triggered by a light beam sensor. As usual, the audio system was pushing enough power to make you think there were real canons being fired.</p>
